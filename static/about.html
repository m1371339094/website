                <p>At Ability Care, we believe everyone deserves to live with dignity, independence, and joy. Our
                    mission is to provide comprehensive, person-centered disability support services that empower

                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Founded in 2009, Ability Care began with a simple vision: to create a support service that truly
                    understands and respects the unique needs of individuals with disabilities. What started as a small
                    team of dedicated caregivers has grown into a comprehensive support organization serving over 500
                    clients across the region.</p>
                <p>Our founder, inspired by personal family experiences with disability care, recognized the need for
                    services that go beyond basic assistance. We focus on building genuine relationships, understanding
                    individual goals, and creating customized support plans that enhance quality of life.</p>
